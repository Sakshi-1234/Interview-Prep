# Interview-Prep

Hello, My name is Sakshi Maske. I am a second-year undergraduate at VIT VELLORE. I am pursuing my Bachelor's in COMPUTER SCIENCE.

I love competitive programming.

I am starting my journey of Interview Preparation by learning Data Structures and Algorithms and I will be sharing all the resources I will be using for practice.
So, go through the files and I hope this will be helpful to you and to me as well in future. Thank You for passing by ;)
